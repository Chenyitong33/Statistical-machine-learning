In this project, you will be applying machine learning for recognising digits from real world images. The project worksheet is a combination of text, pre-implemented code and placeholders where we expect you to add your code and answers. You code should produce desired result within a reasonable amount of time. Please follow the instructions carefully, write your code and give answers only where specifically asked. In addition to worksheet completion, you are also expected to participate live competition with other students in the class. The competition will be run using an on-line platform called Kaggle.
